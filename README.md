# Complete_University_Grade_System
It is a website for University Grade System management, with 3 roles, administrator, professor and student. This project has been made with PHP as backend programming language and with MySQL as Database programming language option. For frontend I used a Dashboard and custom CSS code, and some JavaScript.
